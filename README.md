# Machine Learning Pipeline Dashboard

An interactive **Dash** app for exploring machine learning workflows.
I built this project as an **educational tool** to:
- Deepen my own understanding of core ML concepts (data splitting, scaling, model selection, metrics, etc.), and
- Provide a **beginner-friendly sandbox** where someone new to ML can upload a dataset, try common models, and immediately see how their choices affect performance.
